# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Reqired Homework/ Tasks:
***
### Create an Admin User
I watched the video for [**Ashish's Week 0 - Security Considerations**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EMWBYVggQI&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=15).\
I already created an AWS root account. It is not recommended to work on your AWS root account, so;\
I jumped into the **IAM** dashboard and created a **User group** named as "ADMIN".\
I gave **AdministratosAccess** permisions to this group.
Finaly, I created a new user, and added to the Admin group.

### Create a Billing Alarm via AWS Console
I watched the video for [**Chirag's Week 0 - Spend Considerations**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVw3RrlP-sI&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=13) and set my billing alarm with $5 max. Here is the screenshot of the alarm  I created.

I added the step by step instruction for this at the end of the page under the [**Instructions**](#steps-to-create-a-billing-alarm-on-aws)

### Create a Billing Alarm via AWS CLI
First I created an SNS topic and got the topic-arn. Here is the code:

```
aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
```
Then I created a subscription. Used the code below,

```
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn ***your topic-arn, that you got in the step above***\
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint ***the email you want to subscribe***
```

Finally I created theAlarm with the JSON file listed below, that I created before. Ran the CLI code below. 
- [alarm-config.json](../aws/json/alarm-config.json)\
More information about the JSON file click
[ here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/).\

Run the CLI code below.
```
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm-config.json
```

***
### Create a Budget via AWS Console
After watched the video above, I set my budget to $10 per month. Here is the screenshot for the budget at AWS.

Step by step [**instruction**](#steps-to-set-up-a-budget-on-aws) via AWS console is below as well. 

### Create a budget via AWS CLI
After I created the json files listed below, I typed the folllowing code to create a budget with $10 and 80% treshold.
- [budget.json](../aws/json/budget.json)
- [budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json](../aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json)\
  More information about the JSON files click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html#examples).
```
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id **your-AWS-account-id** \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```

### Installed AWS CLI and Generate AWS Credentials
On my local device I already installed AWS CLI that I was using before. Here is the proof for it.
![Alt text](../_docs/assets/AWS%20CLI%20local.jpg)\
As it stands in the business scenario that fractional CTO has asked that everything be developed in Gitpod,so I set my Gitpod account aswell.\
I have realized that I did not have MFA on my GitHub, first I set it up. Step by step [**instruction**](#steps-to-enable-multi-factor-authentication-on-github) is below.\
Then I created a workspace at Gitpod with my GitHub repository. \
I installed the AWS to the /workspace directory and configured with the code below. [**Installing AWS CLI**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
  
```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
cd .. 
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
aws configure
```
After the installation I checked it;
```
aws --version
aws
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
![Alt text](../_docs/assets/AWS%20CLI%20at%20Gitpod.jpg)\
Before the configuration, I switched to my AWS account and created new Access Key and Secret just for Gitpod. In case in the future if I want to destroy the access key, it will be much easier.\
Lastly, for the future log-ins, to set as desired I have updated the [gitpod.yaml](../.gitpod.yml). Which will install the AWS CLI to the desired location.\
Finally, I needed to set env variables for Acces Key, Secret and Region at gitpod settings. [**Env vars for AWS**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=******use your access key********
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=******use your secret********
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=******your default region********
```
