# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
## Reqired Homework/ Tasks:
***
### Create an Admin User
I already created an AWS root account. It is not recommended to work on your AWS root account, so;
  * I jumped into the **IAM** dashboard and created a **User group** named as "ADMIN".
  * I gave **AdministratosAccess** permisions to this group.
  * Finaly, I created a new user, and added to the Admin group.

### Create a Billing Alarm
I watched the video for [Chirag's Week 0 - Spend Considerations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVw3RrlP-sI&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=13) and set my billing alarm with $5 max. Here isthe screenshot of the alarm  I created.
